## FUBAS - FUnctional BASic - Functional Programming meets BASIC

Copyright (C) 2020 Michael A. Warot

This is what happens when a crazy person tries to make a "functional" programming language out of Tiny BASIC

This is an audacious jump into the abyss.  I've never done functional
programming, and only had it recently summarized in this youtube video by
Uncle Bob Martin --  --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yr-3F6PQo

So the terms I use are likely to be wrong... sorry about that.

My understanding is there shouldn't be variables, and if they
to exist, they should be identities. The reason is multi-core
processors are the norm now, and it's only going to get worse
for anything single-threaded in the future.

So, in FUBAS, there are no variables, only identites, 
which have versions. I'll be winging it as I go.
