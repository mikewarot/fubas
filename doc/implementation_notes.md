## FUBAS - FUnctional BASic - Functional Programming meets BASIC

## Implementation Notes

A dictionary of input and output strings is maintained

$i1 is the first line typed by the user
$o1 is the first line output by the system

typing $o1 is then substituted when reading a command line with
the first line of output 


Entering a blank line causes the interpreter to dump
all of the key/value pairs in memory, then exit.
